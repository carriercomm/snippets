Hi everyone...

The function do_guards, allows the players call from help of a guard to kill their enemies,
this snippet is thinked to avoid battles in a room that is LAW flagged, so the charmers will
have a chance, if the pk's on your mud are a little clever will not risk to fight inside the
city or in a place that is well knowed like a LAW room.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea:

Give more chances to the Charmers!!!

If a player is attacked inside the city (Midgaard is well know as a entire LAW city), he/she can
escape safely from the battle, killing the player that do the attack by a simple command.
So the players will avoid to fight inside a LAW room... So the people that love to charm another 
people will have more chances, because the Pk's will be looking for fight out of the LAW rooms.

I don't know if I'm getting understanded. (My english is not so good, because my native languaje is spanish.
so, sorry for my mistakes, and I'm a little sleepy, I've past the last 3 days programming a lot of things and
I've sleeped a few.)

Well.. the commands is self-explaning.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we go.

1.-

	 Make a backup of your src folder before the installation of this snippet.

2.-

       merc.h

       At the end of the pcdata structure add:

       int			attacker;

3.-

	comm.c

      -- void nanny --
      Before the line that advice that a player as logged in:

      wiznet("$N has left the real life.",ch,NULL,WIZ_LOGINS,WIZ_SITES,get_trust(ch));

      Add:

     	ch->pcdata->attacker = 0;

4.-

      fight.c

	-- void do_murder --

      Change this lines:

    if (IS_NPC(ch))
	sprintf(buf, "Help! %s is triying to murder me!",ch->short_descr);
    else
	sprintf( buf, "Help! %s is triying to murder me!", ch->name );

      for this:

    if (IS_NPC(ch))
	sprintf(buf, "Help! %s is triying to murder me!",ch->short_descr);
    else
    {
      ch->pcdata->attacker = 1;
	sprintf( buf, "Help! %s is triying to murder me!", ch->name );
    }

    -- void stop_fighting --

      Before the lines:

	    fch->position	= IS_NPC(fch) ? fch->default_pos : POS_STANDING;
	    update_pos( fch );
      
      Put this:

          if (!IS_NPC(fch))
          fch->pcdata->attacker = 0;

5.-

     interp.c

     After the line: (or anywhere inside the structure)


    { "goto",		do_goto,		POS_DEAD,	IM,	LOG_NORMAL, 1 },

     Paste this:

    { "guards",		do_guards,		POS_FIGHTING,	0,	LOG_NORMAL, 1 },

5.5.-

      interp.h

      After the bottom of the file add this:

	DECLARE_DO_FUN( do_guards	);

6.-

    In the file limbo.are make a mob called Guard, (or any name that you like).
    and set it with a high level, a high range of hp, and a high amount of damage.
    Because this mob will tag the char in the battle.

    I've setted this mob with 10000d1+1000 hp and 1000d1+1000 damage.
   

7.-

     any file .c (I'have a file where I've putted all my new commands, newcmnd.c)

     Before the line:

	#include "lookup.h"

     Press enter once and paste this:

	#define GUARDIA xxxxx  //xxxxx is the vnum of the mob named guard that you make in limbo.are

     In the DECLARE_DO_FUN section, add this:

	DECLARE_DO_FUN (do_shout);

	----

Paste this void at the end of the file:

void do_guards(CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument)
{
  CHAR_DATA *victim;
  CHAR_DATA *guard;  
  char buf[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];

 if (IS_NPC(ch))
 {
  send_to_char ("Shut up and die!\n\r",ch);
  return;
 }

 victim = ch->fighting;
 guard = NULL;

 if(victim == NULL)
 {
  send_to_char ("You don't need any assistence, you aren't fighting.\n\r",ch);
  return;
 }

 if(IS_NPC(victim))
 {
  send_to_char ("How coward!! You attack a mob and then you ask for assistance?\n\r",ch);
  return;
 }

 if(ch->pcdata->attacker == 1)
 {
  send_to_char ("I think that you are out of the law now.\n\r",ch);
  return;
 }

 // This is the core of the whole thing.
 if(!IS_SET(ch->in_room->room_flags,ROOM_LAW))
 {
  send_to_char ("No guards can help you fighting in this place.\n\r",ch);
  return;
 }

/*
   If you have a definition of ROOM_ARENA, uncomment this.

 if(IS_SET(ch->in_room->room_flags,ROOM_ARENA))
 {
  send_to_char ("No guards can help you fighting in this place.\n\r",ch);
  return;
 }
*/

 sprintf( buf, "Guards, to me!");
 do_shout(ch,buf);
 guard = create_mobile(get_mob_index(GUARD));
 char_to_room(guard,ch->in_room);
 sprintf( buf, "Resist, I'm on my way!");
 REMOVE_BIT(guard->comm, COMM_NOSHOUT);
 do_shout(guard,buf);
 SET_BIT(guard->comm, COMM_NOSHOUT);
 send_to_char("A guard has arrive to assist you in this fight!\n\r",ch);
 act("A guard arrives to help $n!",ch,NULL,NULL,TO_ROOM);

 // The combat is stopped, and the guard starts to attack the outlawed.
 stop_fighting(ch,TRUE);
 stop_fighting(victim,TRUE);
 check_killer( guard, victim );
 multi_hit( guard, victim, TYPE_UNDEFINED );

  return;
}

8.- (Optional part, If you don't like a lot of guards walking everywhere in your mud.)

	update.c

      In the DECLARE_DO_FUN section add:

      DECLARE_DO_FUN (do_shout);

      --------------------------
      I've a function that update chars every second, I've putted this part there.
      If you haven't something like that paste this in:
      -- void mobile_update -- 

      In the variable declaration section add:

	   char buf[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];

      
      Before the line:

     /* Wander */

      Paste this:

     /* Extract the guards that have been created. */ 
      if( IS_NPC(ch) && 		   /* This check is required if you don't put this in mobile_update */
         ch->pIndexData->vnum == xxxxx /* xxxxx = the vnum of your guard. */
      && ch->fighting == NULL )
      {
 	  act( "$n stares at the horizont, he seems to heared a call for help.", ch, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM );
	  sprintf( buf, "Resist, I'm on my way!");
        REMOVE_BIT(ch->comm, COMM_NOSHOUT);
        do_shout(ch,buf);
        SET_BIT(ch->comm, COMM_NOSHOUT);
 	  act( "$n quikly goes, to help the ones that requires.", ch, NULL, NULL, TO_ROOM );
        extract_char(ch,TRUE);
      }


___________________________End of the Installation._________________________________

Well, posterior notes:

- I've programmed this in about 10 minutes, so don't expect this to be perfect.

- I've tested this in a one-to-one fight, I don't know how this will work in a group battle
  but I supossed that the guard will kill the first member of the group (the owner of the group)
  and then will go, and all the chars that were fighting will suffer a stop_fighting
  (If this happens take this like a dramatism, A person dies and all the others get amazed XD ).

- Feel free to change anything... (This is obvious! :))

- I don't ask for any credit, but any comment or help will be gratefully readed in my email
  or in Mudmagic and any cigarette or beer will be thanked ;)

- Any upgrade or debug, post it in Mudmagic (Kyndig for the whole family XD)

- If you speak spanish, take a look around Nueva Thoria MUD. XDD

- This command works pretty funny if you eliminate the command recall, so your
  players must walk, and this makes easily the encounters out of the city.
  (I've removed the recall command in my mud, just to make the players life a whole hell)

- Nothing else.

Once again, sorry my bad english, as I told you before, I'm not so good at this languaje.
well, I think that's all folks.
