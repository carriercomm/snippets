in ACT_OBJ.C:

find do_sacrifice, and look for this bit of code -


    if ( !IS_NPC( ch ) && ch->pcdata->deity && ch->pcdata->deity->name[0] != '\0' )
    {
        strcpy( name, ch->pcdata->deity->name );
    }
    else if ( !IS_NPC( ch ) && IS_GUILDED(ch) && sysdata.guild_overseer[0] != '\0' )
    {
        strcpy( name, sysdata.guild_overseer );
    }
    else if ( !IS_NPC( ch ) && ch->pcdata->clan && ch->pcdata->clan->deity[0] != '\0' )
    {
        strcpy( name, ch->pcdata->clan->deity );
    }
    else
    {
        strcpy( name, "Thoric" );
    }


This is the part that adds the name of the deity who gives the character one gold coin
for the sacrifice. The part we are interested in is the part that causes it to default
to 'Thoric'. Replace that else statement with this -



    else
    {
        static char * god_name_table [ ] =
        {
                "Adam", "Bob", "Charlie", "etc",
        };
        strcpy(name, god_name_table[number_range(0,3)]);
    }


Of course, you will want to replace those names with any deities you wish (presumably
with names from your own mud). Remember to replace the arguments passed to number_range
with the correct numbers, matching the number of deities you plug into this block. Enjoy.
