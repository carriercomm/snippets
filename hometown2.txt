define a new field in merc.h
 under pc_race_type I added a new int for a "hometown"
ie:

int     hometown; 

then update your pc_race entries in const.c
from the normal:

{ 
  "Human", "Hum", 0, { 100, 100, 100, 100 },
 { 13, 13, 13, 13, 13 },   {18, 18, 18, 18, 18 }, SIZE_MEDIUM
}

to:

 {
 "Human", "Hum", 0, { 100, 100, 100, 100 },
  { 13, 13, 13, 13, 13 },  {18, 18, 18, 18, 18 }, SIZE_MEDIUM, 3005
 }                                                             ^- recall vnum
 
then in do_recall() just point out the room vnum normally defined with
ROOM_VNUM_TEMPLE to something like pc_race_table[ch->race].hometown

That'll send them to specific rooms based on race, if you wanna do it based
on alignment, or something else, what i did was add a bit to pc_data in
merc.h and then define it in nanny() while the player is creating, 
specifically during the "What is your alignment (G/N/E): " section.
I don't know if NPC's are checked to disable the recall command, but 
thats how we have it, otherwise the new pcdata integer will read squat on
a mob and you get a fancy core file :)
Remember to add support for the pc_data entry if you do it that way, in 
fread_char() and fwrite_char() so it read and writes the new info.
