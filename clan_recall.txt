Well, Commander Boston gave me the idea, and I went ahead and coded it.

Here is a functional clan recall. Just follow the directions!

Of course, you can write your own help for it.  Give me credit, if you want.  
This thing was quite easy to code, and I'm ashamed that I'd even consider
taking credit for the code, which was totally written by Russ for ROM2.4b2,
except for about 34 characters. ;)
Enjoy.

*******************************************************************************
add something like this 
to help.are
***********************
-1 CLANRECALL~
syntax:  clanrecall [enter]
Clanrecall is used by clan members to recall back to their clan rooms,
instead of to the generic mud recall room.
~


Add this to interp.h
******************
DECLARE_DO_FUN(	do_clan_recall	);  /* Froth of Dyre MUD */

Add this line to interp.c
*******************
 { "clanrecall",do_clan_recall,	POS_FIGHTING,	 0,  LOG_NORMAL, 1 },


Add this  stuff to act_move.c
